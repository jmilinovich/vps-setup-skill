# Claude Assistant Guide

This document is specifically for Claude (or any AI assistant) helping with this server in future sessions.

## Context & Purpose

**Owner Profile**: [SKILL_LEVEL] developer learning server management
**Server Purpose**: [PURPOSE]
**Communication Style**: Explain things simply, avoid jargon when possible

## Pre-Flight Checklist

When starting a new session, quickly check:
```bash
# 1. What's currently running?
pm2 list

# 2. Server resources
df -h          # Disk space
free -h        # Memory

# 3. Recent activity
ls -la /home/projects/

# 4. Check services
systemctl status nginx
```

## Common User Requests

### "Deploy my GitHub project"
1. Always deploy to `/home/projects/`
2. Ask for the GitHub URL
3. Check if it's Node.js, Python, or other
4. Use PM2 for Node.js apps
5. Assign a unique port (check `pm2 list` for used ports)

### "My app isn't working"
1. Check PM2 logs first: `pm2 logs [app-name]`
2. Verify port isn't already taken: `lsof -i :[port]`
3. Check if dependencies are installed
4. Verify firewall allows the port: `ufw status`

### "How do I update my project?"
```bash
cd /home/projects/[project-name]
git pull
npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt
pm2 restart [project-name]
```

## Technical Details

### System Architecture
```
Internet → UFW Firewall → Nginx (port 80/443) → Apps (ports 3000+)
                        ↘ Direct access to app ports (3000-3010)
```

### PM2 Ecosystem
- PM2 daemon runs as root
- Apps auto-restart on crash
- Logs stored in: `~/.pm2/logs/`
- Config saved in: `~/.pm2/`

### Available Resources
- **IP Address**: [SERVER_IP]
- **Domain**: [DOMAIN]

## Security Considerations

### Already Configured
- UFW firewall with specific ports
- fail2ban for SSH protection

### Recommended Improvements
- SSH key-only authentication
- Non-root user for daily operations
- Regular security updates

## Important File Locations

```bash
/home/projects/              # All projects go here
/etc/nginx/sites-available/  # Nginx configs
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/    # Active nginx configs
~/.pm2/logs/                 # PM2 app logs
/var/log/nginx/              # Nginx logs
```

## Quick Fixes

### "Port already in use"
```bash
lsof -i :[port]           # Find what's using it
pm2 delete [app-name]     # If it's a PM2 app
kill -9 [PID]             # Force kill if needed
```

### "Can't connect to my app"
```bash
ufw status                # Check if port is open
ufw allow [port]/tcp      # Open it if needed
```

### "App keeps crashing"
```bash
pm2 logs [app-name] --err # See errors
pm2 describe [app-name]   # Check restart count
```

## Session Handoff Notes

For the next Claude session, note any:
- New projects deployed
- Ports assigned
- Configuration changes made
- Issues encountered and solutions

**Remember**: Be encouraging, explain what you're doing, and help understand rather than just fixing things silently.

**Philosophy**: "Teach them to fish" - explain commands and what they do.
